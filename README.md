# Micro Complaints
This project is a proof of concept for handling customer complaints with a focus on performance.
This is our first attempt at making project with a rust backend using [actix-web](https://actix.rs).

## Features
1. Filing a complaint
2. Email notification upon submission and resolution of complaint
3. Storing complaints in a postgreSQL database
4. Mail server storing responses in a mysql database
5. oAuth login using google
6. Website built with React
7. Complaints dashboard (only visible to employees/supporters)
8. Permission system via user roles

## Future plans
- [ ] Add build feature for the backend to be without the authentication
